A small project that popped up in my google now feed, decided to give it a go.  Guide by CodeCademy and featured on Medium:

TO MAKE AN EXTENSION LOCALLY IN CHROME:

Enable Developer mode in chrome:
  1.  Open a new tab, and navigate to chrome://extensions. Inside this tab, click on the Developer Mode checkbox in the top right corner.
  2.  Once that is checked, some buttons will appear. Click on Load Unpacked Extensionâ€¦ to open the file browser.
  3.  Navigate to your JavaScript Tips Tab project folder and select it. This enables the extension.

When a new tab in Chrome opens, a new JS tip is displayed!

Note: You'll be prompted to disable your developer features every time you open Chrome from scratch.
